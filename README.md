# matplotlib_homework
A new pharmaceutical company specialising in anti-cancer drugs. It recently began looking into potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a common type of skin cancer. This dataset contains all of the pharmaceutical data from their most recent animal experiment. In this study, 249 mice with SCC tumour growth were given a variety of drug regimens. Tumor development was observed and measured over the course of 45 days. The goal of this study was to compare the efficacy of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, to the performance of the other treatment regimens. Furthermore, to analyse, virtualise, give insights, do a regression analysis, Python matplotlib has been adopted as an efficient and systematic means to analyse the dataset.Â
